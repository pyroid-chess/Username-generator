# Username Generator

This project is a simple username generator written in Python. It offers both a GUI and non-GUI mode for generating completely random usernames. Please note that the usernames generated are entirely random, so it's quite rare to get a genuinely "good" or meaningful username. The project is intended just for fun!

## Features

- Generates random usernames.
- Includes both graphical (GUI) and command-line (non-GUI) interfaces.
- Lightweight and easy to run.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- For GUI mode: `tkinter` (usually included with standard Python installations)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pyroid-chess/Username-generator.git
   cd Username-generator
   ```

2. (Optional) Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install any additional dependencies (if required):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *Note: If `requirements.txt` does not exist, most likely you only need Python and tkinter.*

## Usage

- **Non-GUI Mode:**
  ```bash
  python username_generator.py
  ```

- **GUI Mode:**
  ```bash
  python username_generator_gui.py
  ```

## Notes

- The generated usernames are completely random and often nonsensical.
- Getting a "good" username is rareâ€”this is part of the fun!
- This project is not intended for serious use; it's just for entertainmet.

Happy username generating!
